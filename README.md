# Playwright Sharp UI test example - Auth0 website

This is a .NET Core Test Project to show how to use [Playwright Sharp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-sharp) library for UI testing. We test the [Auth0 website](https://auth0.com/). 

The test verifies that ["Regular Web App" for ASP.NET Core](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/webapp/aspnet-core) Quickstart guide is working, and the link to the GitHub repository where the sample code lives is correct.

To run the test, the project uses [NUnit](https://nunit.org/).
